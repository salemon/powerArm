  By not providing "Findmoveit_robot_trajectory.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "moveit_robot_trajectory", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "moveit_robot_trajectory" with any of the following names:

    moveit_robot_trajectoryConfig.cmake
    moveit_robot_trajectory-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "moveit_robot_trajectory" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "moveit_robot_trajectory_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "moveit_robot_trajectory" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
